<hr>

# Technologies
Several technologies were used:
* Java is the programming language used
* HTML/CSS to develop the application's frontend
* Spring Framework to create the web application
* Eureka Server to find the various microservices
* API Gateway to create load balancers between microservices
* Thymeleaf to connect the backend and frontend
* Data JPA to connect to the database
* SpringSecurity to manage permissions and authenticate users
* MySQL as the database
* CodeProjectAI server with the YOLOv5 model and previously trained weights (the training is [in this](https://github.com/ttiagojm/GrocerEyeYOLOv5) repository)
